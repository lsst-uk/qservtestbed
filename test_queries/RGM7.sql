/* Q7: Ben Burningham wants to detect intrinsically faint nearby white dwarf stars through their high proper motions.
Model this as a query on GPS for stars with reduced proper motion (from accurate proper motions) above some value as a function of colour. 

Select reliable point sources with reliable proper motions and look at plot with Y-K and then the white dwarfs should be in a sparse, blue locus.*/

/*No proper motions in DR8 */
